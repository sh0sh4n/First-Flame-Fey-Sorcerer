			<p>Your innate magic comes from a connection to the Feywild, a vibrant plane of unearthly beings and eternal twilight. The origin of your powers might be a union between an archfey and a beloved mortal or you might have received a boon for some deed or service. Perhaps you have a dryad in your ancestry, or you might be a scion of a powerful eladrin bloodline.
			<p class="indent">Whatever the source, you have within you a knack for the beguiling magic that is the mark of one who may be destined to become an archfey themselves.</p>

			<p>Your connection to the fey has granted you a powerful, hypnotic voice. At 1st level, you gain proficiency in either Intimidation or Persuasion and the ability to speak, read and write Sylvan. You also learn the <span class="italic">command</span></p> spell, which counts as a sorcerer spell for you, and does not count against your number of spells known.
			<p class="indent">Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check while interacting with Fey creature, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 1st level, your link to the Feywild allows you to learn spells that weave enchantment and illusion. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to learn an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice from the Bard or Wizard spell list, in addition to the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 6th level, you can project a powerful burst of fey magic to enchant or frighten your foes. You glamour yourself into an image of great attraction or fear to your targets. As an action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cause creatures of your choice within a 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC.
			<p class="indent">The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). A creature affected by this ability makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p>
